Welcome to **jscpd**, a powerful copy/paste detector for programming source code that supports **150+ languages and formats**.

## What is jscpd?

jscpd is a tool that helps you find duplicated blocks in programming source code. Copy/paste is a common source of technical debt in software projects, and jscpd helps you identify and eliminate these duplications.

The tool implements the [Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) for efficient searching of duplications across large codebases.

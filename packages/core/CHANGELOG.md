# @jscpd/core

## 4.2.4

### Patch Changes

- Features
  - detectClonesAndStatistic() API — new function returning both clone results and statistics in one call; also exposes an optional statisticProvider injection point on detectClones. Closes #536, #549.
    Bug Fixes
  - .gitignore not respected by default — gitignore option now defaults to true; patterns are read from every scanned directory (not just process.cwd()); fix applies to both CLI and programmatic API. Use --no-gitignore to opt out. Fixes #790.
  - .gitignore negation patterns silently dropped — negated patterns (!test.js, !src/\*\*, etc.) were discarded instead of being passed to fast-glob. Fixes #723.
    Documentation
  - Document path option in .jscpd.json and package.json config examples. (#717)
  - Add Gitignore option section to README with CLI examples, config snippet, and default/type reference.
  - Add detectClonesAndStatistic API example to README.

## 4.2.3

### Patch Changes

- fix(finder): resolve relative ignore patterns against scan dirs (#611)

## 4.2.2

### Patch Changes

- fix(tokenizer): resolve quadratic bash tokenization hang

## 4.2.1

### Patch Changes

- fix tokenization issue for cross formats detection

## 4.2.0 — 2026-05-14

### Bug Fixes

- **Entire-file duplicates silently dropped** (#728) — the RabinKarp detector flushed the pending clone on a store _hit_ at end-of-file instead of on a _miss_. When the sentinel frame triggered a hit, the final pending clone was validated and discarded rather than added to the results. Files that are complete copies of each other were silently undetected.
- **Vue SFC cross-file detection broken** — `Detector` called `store.namespace(format)` once using the file-level format (`vue`) for all SFC block token maps. The namespace now switches per token map to the resolved sub-format (e.g. `javascript`, `typescript`, `scss`), enabling cross-file detection between SFC blocks and standalone files of the same language.

### Breaking Changes

- **Vue SFC store namespace** — clone results for `.vue` files now appear under the block's resolved sub-format (`javascript`, `typescript`, `markup`, `css`, `scss`, `less`) instead of `vue`. Any consumer that filters or groups results by format name will need to handle these new names.

### Dependency Updates

- `@jscpd/tokenizer` → 4.2.0

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Update hash function, improve performance and keep browser support

Core types, interfaces, events, and utilities shared across all jscpd packages. This package defines the fundamental data structures — clones, tokens, source files, stores, and reporters — that everything else is built on.

- CI now tests against Node.js 22.x and 24.x; Node.js 20.x dropped.

### Breaking Changes

- **Monorepo restructure** — the package was extracted from the old monorepo layout into the new `packages/core` location. Import paths are unchanged but the build system has changed from `tsc` to `tsup`, producing clean ESM+CJS dual-mode bundles.
- Test runner migrated from `ava` to **Vitest**.
- Requires **Node.js 18+**.

### Changes

- Cyclic dependency between `@jscpd/core` and `@jscpd/tokenizer` removed.
- Interfaces cleaned up; unused code removed.

First release of `@jscpd/core` as a separate package in the monorepo, splitting core functionality out of the main `jscpd` package to enable independent versioning.

- Removed cyclic dependency between core and tokenizer packages.
- Internal imports and interfaces reorganised.
